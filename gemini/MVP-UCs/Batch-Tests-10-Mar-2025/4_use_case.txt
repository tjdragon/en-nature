I need a romantic French restaurant in the city center of Chicago.

I found some romantic French restaurants in downtown Chicago, perfect for a special evening:

*   **Les Nomades:** Offers classic French fine dining in a romantic setting with a fireplace and an extensive wine list.
    *   Rating: 4.7 stars
*   **Bistro Monadnock:** Features French fare such as escargot, steak frites, and gnocchi in a romantic space.
    *   Rating: 4.8 stars
*   **La Grande Boucherie Chicago:** Serves French brasserie dishes in a Belle Époque-era space with stained glass windows.
    *   Rating: 4.6 stars

Would you like more details on any of these options?
