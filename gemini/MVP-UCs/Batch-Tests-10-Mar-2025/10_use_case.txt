I found five Mediterranean restaurants in the historic district of New York. Here are a couple of options that seem to fit the bill:

*   **Omars Mediterranean Cuisine:** A casual spot for Middle Eastern comfort food.
    *   Address: 15 Ann St, New York, NY 10038, USA
    *   Rating: 4.8 (348 reviews)

*   **ilili Restaurant:** An upscale eatery offering small plates and traditional Mediterranean meals, along with wine, beer, and cocktails.
    *   Address: 236 5th Ave, New York, NY 10001, USA
    *   Rating: 4.5 (3844 reviews)

Would you like more details on either of these options?
