What restaurants in Seattle have flexible operational hours to suit different schedules?

To give you the best recommendations, could you tell me more about what you mean by "flexible operational hours"?

For example, are you looking for:

*   Restaurants that are open 24 hours?
*   Restaurants that open very early for breakfast?
*   Restaurants that stay open very late for dinner or late-night snacks?
*   Restaurants that have different hours on different days of the week?

Once I have a better understanding of your needs, I can provide a more tailored list of options.
