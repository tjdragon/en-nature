Find me an Indian restaurant in San Francisco with a quiet ambience for conversation.

Here are some Indian restaurants in San Francisco that often receive positive reviews:

*   **Nepa Indian Cuisine:** Serves Nepalese and northern Indian cuisine in a casual setting. (Rating: 4.9, Price Level: €€)
*   **Sunset Indian Cuisine:** Known for serving Indian and Himalayan dishes late. (Rating: 4.9, Price Level: €€)

Many of the other restaurants in the search results also receive very positive reviews, but note that Amber India, North India, Ocean Indian Cuisine, and Tiya get somewhat lower scores (between 4.2 and 4.5).

To refine this, do you have any specific preferences regarding location, price, or the type of Indian cuisine served (e.g., North Indian, South Indian, etc.)?
