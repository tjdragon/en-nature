Show me places in Atlanta with robust reservation policies.

Can you clarify what you mean by "robust" reservation policies? Are you looking for restaurants that:

*   Require reservations well in advance?
*   Have very strict cancellation policies?
*   Are known for honoring reservations promptly?
*   Offer a variety of ways to make reservations (e.g., online, phone, app)?

The more information you provide, the better I can tailor the search to your specific needs.
