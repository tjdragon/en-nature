What restaurants in Chicago offer specialized menus for vegetarians and vegans?

Okay, I see a variety of options. Since it sounds like you're looking for something that focuses on vegetarian and vegan options, I recommend the following, based on their great reviews:

*   **elephant + vine:** (Rating: 4.6, Price Level: €)
*   **Hippy Eats and Spiritual Healing** (Rating: 4.9, Price Level: undefined, but likely inexpensive as it's a food truck)
*   **Vegan Plate** (Rating: 4.8)

To refine this list further, do you have any preference regarding a specific cuisine, price range, or neighborhood?
